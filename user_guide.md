# Using Kubeflow

This guide will walk you through the basics of deploying and interacting with Kubeflow. Some understanding of Kubernetes, Tensorflow, and Ksonnet are useful in completing the contents of this guide.

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/)
* [Ksonnet](https://ksonnet.io/docs/tutorial)

## Requirements
 * Kubernetes >= 1.8 [see here](https://github.com/tensorflow/k8s#requirements)
 * ksonnet version [0.8.0](https://ksonnet.io/#get-started) or later. (See [below](#why-kubeflow-uses-ksonnet) for an explanation of why we use ksonnet)

## Deploy Kubeflow

We will be using Ksonnet to deploy kubeflow into your cluster.

Initialize a directory to contain your ksonnet application.

```
ks init my-kubeflow
```

Install the Kubeflow packages into your application.

```
cd my-kubeflow
ks registry add kubeflow github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/v0.001/kubeflow
ks pkg install kubeflow/core
ks pkg install kubeflow/tf-serving
ks pkg install kubeflow/tf-job
```

Create the Kubeflow core component. The core component includes
  * JupyterHub
  * TensorFlow job controller


```
NAMESPACE=kubeflow
kubectl create namespace ${NAMESPACE}
ks generate core kubeflow-core --name=kubeflow-core --namespace=${NAMESPACE}
```
  * Feel free to change the namespace to a value that better suits your kubernetes cluster.


Ksonnet allows us to parameterize the Kubeflow deployment according to our needs. We will define two environments: nocloud, and cloud.


```
ks env add nocloud
ks env add cloud
```

The `nocloud` environment can be used for minikube or other basic k8s clusters, the `cloud` environment will be used for GKE in this guide.

If using GKE, we can configure our cloud environment to use GCP features with a single parameter:

```
ks param set kubeflow-core cloud gke --env=cloud
```

Now let's set `${KF_ENV}` to `cloud` or `nocloud` to reflect our environment for the rest of the guide:

```
$ KF_ENV=cloud|nocloud
```

And apply the components to our Kubernetes cluster

```
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c kubeflow-core
```

At any time you can inspect the kubernetes objects definitions for a particular ksonnet component using `ks show` e.g

```
ks show ${KF_ENV} -c kubeflow-core
```

### Bringing up a Notebook

The kubeflow-core component deployed JupyterHub and a corresponding load balancer service. You can check its status using the kubectl command line.

```commandline
kubectl get svc -n=${NAMESPACE}

NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
tf-hub-0           ClusterIP      None            <none>        8000/TCP       1m
tf-hub-lb          ClusterIP      10.11.245.94    <none>        80/TCP         1m
tf-job-dashboard   ClusterIP      10.11.240.151   <none>        80/TCP         1m
```

By default we are using ClusterIPs for the JupyterHub UI. This can be changed to a LoadBalancer by issuing `ks param set kubeflow-core jupyterHubServiceType LoadBalancer`, however this will leave your Notebook open to the Internet.

To connect to your notebook:

```
PODNAME=`kubectl get pods --namespace=${NAMESPACE} --selector="app=tf-hub" --output=template --template="{{with index .items 0}}{{.metadata.name}}{{end}}"`
kubectl port-forward --namespace=${NAMESPACE} $PODNAME 8000:8000
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

You should see a sign in prompt.

1. Sign in using any username/password
1. Click the "Start My Server" button, you will be greeted by a dialog screen.
  1. Set the image to `gcr.io/kubeflow/tensorflow-notebook-cpu:v1` or `gcr.io/kubeflow/tensorflow-notebook-gpu:8fbc341245695e482848ac3c2034a99f7c1e5763` depending on whether doing CPU or GPU training, or whether or not you have GPUs in your cluster.
  1. Allocate memory, CPU, GPU, or other resources according to your need (1 CPU and 2Gi of Memory are good starting points)
  1. Click Spawn
1. Eventually you should now be greeted with a Jupyter interface. Note that the GPU image is several gigabytes in size and may take a few minutes to download and start.

The image supplied above can be used for training Tensorflow models with Jupyter. The images include all the requisite plugins, including [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) that you can use for rich visualizations and insights into your models.

To test the install, we can run a basic hello world (adapted from [mnist_softmax.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.4/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_softmax.py) )

```
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot=True)

import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])

W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))

y = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(x, W) + b)

y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])
cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(-tf.reduce_sum(y_ * tf.log(y), reduction_indices=[1]))

train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.05).minimize(cross_entropy)

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
tf.global_variables_initializer().run()

for _ in range(1000):
  batch_xs, batch_ys = mnist.train.next_batch(100)
  sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={x: batch_xs, y_: batch_ys})

correct_prediction = tf.equal(tf.argmax(y,1), tf.argmax(y_,1))
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, tf.float32))
print(sess.run(accuracy, feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y_: mnist.test.labels}))
```

Paste the example into a new Python 3 Jupyter notebook and execute the code, this should result in a 0.9014 accuracy result against the test data.

Please note that when running on most cloud providers, the public IP address will be exposed to the internet and is an
unsecured endpoint by default. For a production deployment with SSL and authentication, refer to the [documentation](components/jupyterhub).

### Serve a model

We treat each deployed model as a [component](https://ksonnet.io/docs/tutorial#2-generate-and-deploy-an-app-component) in your APP.

Create a component for your model

```
MODEL_COMPONENT=serveInception
MODEL_NAME=inception
MODEL_PATH=gs://kubeflow-models/inception
ks generate tf-serving ${MODEL_COMPONENT} --name=${MODEL_NAME} --namespace=${NAMESPACE} --model_path=${MODEL_PATH}
```

Deploy the model component. Ksonnet will pick up existing parameters for your environment (e.g. cloud, nocloud) and customize the resulting deployment appropriately

```
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c ${MODEL_COMPONENT}
```

As before, a few pods and services have been created in your cluster. You can get the inception serving endpoint by querying kubernetes:

```
kubectl get svc inception -n=${NAMESPACE}
NAME        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
inception   LoadBalancer   10.35.255.136   ww.xx.yy.zz   9000:30936/TCP   28m
```

In this example, you should be able to use the inception_client to hit ww.xx.yy.zz:9000

### Submiting a TensorFlow training job

We treat each TensorFlow job as a [component](https://ksonnet.io/docs/tutorial#2-generate-and-deploy-an-app-component) in your APP.

Create a component for your job.

```
JOB_NAME=myjob
ks generate tf-job ${JOB_NAME} --name=${JOB_NAME} --namespace=${NAMESPACE}
```

To configure your job you need to set a bunch of parameters. To see a list of parameters run

```
ks prototype describe tf-job
```

Parameters can be set using `ks param` e.g. to set the Docker image used

```
IMAGE=gcr.io/tf-on-k8s-dogfood/tf_sample:d4ef871-dirty-991dde4
ks param set ${JOB_NAME} image ${IMAGE}
```

You can also edit the `params.libsonnet` files directly to set parameters.

**Warning** Currently setting args via the command line doesn't work because of escaping issues (see [ksonnet/ksonnet/issues/235](https://github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet/issues/235)). So to set the parameters you will need
to directly edit the `params.libsonnet` file directly.

To run your job

```
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c ${JOB_NAME}
```

For information on monitoring your job please refer to the [TfJob docs](https://github.com/tensorflow/k8s#monitoring-your-job).

#### Run the TfCnn example

Kubeflow ships with a [ksonnet prototype](https://ksonnet.io/docs/concepts#prototype) suitable for running the [TensorFlow CNN Benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks).

Create the component

```
CNN_JOB_NAME=mycnnjob
ks generate tf-cnn ${CNN_JOB_NAME} --name=${CNN_JOB_NAME} --namespace=${NAMESPACE}
```

Submit it

```
ks apply ${KF_ENV} -c ${CNN_JOB_NAME}
```

The prototype provides a bunch of parameters to control how the job runs (e.g. use GPUs run distributed etc...). To see a list of paramets

```
ks prototype describe tf-cnn
```

## Advanced Customization

* Often times data scientists require a POSIX compliant filesystem
   * For example, most HDF5 libraries require POSIX and don't work with an object store like GCS or S3
* When working with teams you might want a shared POSIX filesystem to be mounted into your notebook environments
  so that data scientists can work collaboratively on the same datasets.
* Here we show how to customize your Kubeflow deployment to achieve this.


Set the disks parameter to a comma separated list of the Google persistent disks you want to mount
  * These disks should be in the same zone as your cluster
  * These disks need to be created manually via gcloud or the Cloud console e.g.
  * These disks can't be attached to any existing VM or POD.

Create the disks

```
  gcloud --project=${PROJECT} compute disks create  --zone=${ZONE} ${PD_DISK1} --description="PD to back NFS storage on GKE." --size=1TB
  gcloud --project=${PROJECT} compute disks create  --zone=${ZONE} ${PD_DISK2} --description="PD to back NFS storage on GKE." --size=1TB
```

Configure the environment to use the disks.

```
ks param set --env=cloud nfs disks ${PD_DISK1},${PD_DISK2}
```

Deploy the environment

```
ks apply cloud
```

Start Juptyer
You should see your NFS volumes mounted as `/mnt/${DISK_NAME}`

In a Juptyer cell you can run

```
!df
```

You should see output like the following

```

  * Here `jlewi-kubeflow-test1` and `jlewi-kubeflow-test2` are the names of the PDs.

## Why Kubeflow Uses Ksonnet

[Ksonnet](https://ksonnet.io/) is a command line tool that makes it easier to manage complex deployments consisting of multiple components. It is designed to
work side by side with kubectl.

Ksonnet allows us to generate Kubernetes manifests from parameterized templates. This makes it easy to customize Kubernetes manifests for your
particular use case. In the examples above we used this functionality to generate manifests for TfServing with a user supplied URI for the model.

One of the reasons we really like ksonnet is because it treats [environment](https://ksonnet.io/docs/concepts#environment) as in (dev, test, staging, prod) as a first class concept. For each environment we can easily deploy the same components but with slightly different parameters
to customize it for a particular environments. We think this maps really well to common workflows. For example, this feature makes it really
easy to run a job locally without GPUs for a small number of steps to make sure the code doesn't crash, and then easily move that to the
Cloud to run at scale with GPUs.
